                                 Hemkund Sahib, also known as Gurudwara Sri Hemkund Sahib Ji is a sikh pilgrimage located in the Chamoli district of Uttarakhand. The place adorned by a glacial lake, is surrounded by seven snow clad peaks, each bearing a Nishan Sahib. At an astounding altitude of 4,362 m, Hemkund Sahib attracts a great number of tourists every trekking season. It is only accessible during summer as it is totally snow bound during the winter season.

One can make it to the Gurudwara by either scaling a 13 kms long path by foot or by taking a pony ride. Close to the place is the Valley of Flowers National Park which offers a magnificent view of complementing colours orchestrated by the cool setting, making the whole area one of the best places to visit in summer in India.Resorts<strong>HEMAKUND</strong> <br>

                                   Kullu Manali has been the most popular tourist destination in India for many years. It still holds a lot of attraction for tourists and is a great place to visit to beat the heat and enjoy some cold weather. Even though proper Manali has become over crowded there are many great places to visit near Manali such as Nagar, Manikaran etc.

                                   Shimla was the summer capital of the British for a reason. It is a great place to cool off in the summers. You can visit nearby places such as Kufri, Naldehra, Chail, Kasauli etc. or just enjoy the shopping at the Mall road. Jakhoo temple gives a good opportunity to tourists to test their endurance as they climb the steep hill to see the magnificent 108 feet Hanuman Statue which happens to be the worldâ€™s tallest hanuman statue in the world.
